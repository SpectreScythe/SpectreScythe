## Some random puns I made along the way...
- 🌹 Roses are #FF0000, 🌺 violets are #0000FF, unexpected '{' on line 32.
- My code has more 🐞 bugs than a 🌳 forest 🌳 in springtime.
- I code therefore I am... frequently confused.
- I think the 🟥 Red Army 🟥 was right, because it's OUR code.
- Coding is my mental cardio.
